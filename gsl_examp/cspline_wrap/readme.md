This is a wrapping of the cubic spline function from the GSL library in C

it is faster than scipy interpolation functions and has a similarly nice interface.

This is heavily inspired by Ross Daley's repo (if not completely)
The aim is to use that as a starting point and learn more about Python wrapping of C-code. It will be useful for further excursions, eg. wrapping the cosmo codes written in C
